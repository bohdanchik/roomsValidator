There are 2 ways to check my program

1) You can use program interface
Go to page
http://localhost:8080/validateRoom
Add the coordinates and check/draw your room!

Pls remember that you always start at coordinate [0,0];

My program always connects to database and get saved points from it.
Don't remember to clear coordinates if you want to draw another room.
You can easy do it using program interface in browser - only press the button "Clear coordinates"!

2) You can use POST
as example

//true (square)
{
    "room": [
        {"x": 100, "y": 0},
        {"x": 100, "y": 100},
        {"x": 0, "y": 100},
        {"x": 0, "y": 0}
        ]
}

//false (less than 4 corners)
{
    "room": [
        {"x": 100, "y": 0},
        {"x": 100, "y": 100},
        ]
}
//false (diagonall walls)
{
    "room": [
        {"x": 100, "y": 0},
        {"x": 90, "y": 100},
        {"x": 0, "y": 90},
        {"x": 10, "y": 60}
        ]
}
// L shaped room
{
    "room": [
        {"x": 100, "y": 0},
        {"x": 100, "y": 100},
        {"x": 200, "y": 100},
        {"x": 200, "y": 200},
        {"x": 0, "y": 200},
        {"x": 0, "y": 0}
        ]
}

Thank u! Have a nice day!
